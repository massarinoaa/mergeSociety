        {`In React, we use JSX (JavaScript XML) to define the structure and
        content of our user interfaces. JSX is like a superpower that lets us
        create dynamic and reusable UI elements with ease. Let's dive into the
        world of creating and rendering JSX files, starting with the basics.`}

      <h3>Understanding the React Project Structure</h3>

      <p>
        {`When you create a new React project, you'll find a bunch of folders and
        files all working together. It might look something like this:`}
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          {`
my-app/
├── public/
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── manifest.json
│   ├── robots.txt
│   └── ...
├── src/
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── App.test.js
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── logo.svg
│   ├── serviceWorker.js
│   └── ...
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── node_modules/
├── .gitignore
└── ...
`}
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        The <code>src</code>{" "}
        {`folder is where the magic happens! This is where
        you'll create your JSX files, design your UI elements, and write awesome
        JavaScript code. It's like the heart of your React application.`}
      </p>

      <p>
        The <code>public</code> folder holds static files that your application
        needs, like icons, the main HTML file (<code>index.html</code>), and
        other assets. Think of it as the public face of your application.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <code>package.json</code>{" "}
        {`file is like a map that guides your
        project. It contains important information about your project's
        dependencies, scripts, and other settings. It helps tools like npm (Node
        Package Manager) manage your project's needs.`}
      </p>

      <p>
        To set up a new React project with everything in place, you can use a
        handy tool called{" "}
        <a
          href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          Create React App
        </a>
        . {`It's like a project wizard that does the heavy lifting for you.`}
      </p>

      <h3>Starting Fresh: Cleaning Up Unnecessary Files (Optional)</h3>

      <p>
        If you want to start with a clean slate, you can choose to delete some
        existing files within the <code>src</code> folder. This step is
        completely optional, but it can be helpful to avoid any confusion. Here
        are the files you can wave goodbye to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>App.css</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>App.js</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>App.test.js</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>index.css</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>index.js</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>logo.svg</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>serviceWorker.js</code>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        {`By deleting these files, you're creating a blank canvas to work on. It's
        like starting with a fresh notebook, ready to fill with your creative
        JSX ideas.`}
      </p>

      <h3>Creating JSX Files: Building Your UI Elements</h3>

      <p>
        Within the <code>src</code> folder, you can create new JSX files to
        define your UI elements and bring them to life. These files will contain
        your JSX code, which is like a blueprint for your user interface.{" "}
        {`Let's
        create a simple JSX file named`}{" "}
        <code>MyJSXFile.js</code>:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          {`
// src/MyJSXFile.js
import React from 'react';

// This is your JSX content
<div>
  <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>
  <p>This is my JSX content.</p>
</div>
`}
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        In this JSX file, we start by inviting React to the party with{" "}
        <code>import React from {` 'react' `}</code>. Then, we use JSX to
        describe what our UI should look like. In this example, we have a{" "}
        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> that holds an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading
        and a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> paragraph. Think of JSX as a mix of HTML
        and JavaScript, giving you the power to create dynamic interfaces.
      </p>

      <h3>Rendering JSX Files: Bringing Your UI to the Screen</h3>

      <p>
        Now,{" "}
        {`let's make our JSX content visible in the browser. We'll create a
        new `}{" "}
        <code>index.js</code> file within the <code>src</code> folder:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          {`
// src/index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import MyJSXFile from './MyJSXFile';

// Render the JSX content
ReactDOM.render(<MyJSXFile />, document.getElementById('root'));
`}
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        Here, we bring in React and ReactDOM. ReactDOM gives us the{" "}
        <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> method, which is like a magician that
        makes our JSX content appear on the screen. We tell it what to render
        and where to render it.
      </p>

      <p>
        We import our <code>MyJSXFile</code> that contains our JSX content.
        Then, we use <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> to make it visible. We tell
        it to render our JSX content (<code>&lt;MyJSXFile /&gt;</code>) and
        where to put it on the screen (
        <code>{`document.getElementById('root')`}</code>).
      </p>

      <h4>
        The <code>index.html</code> File: The Starting Point
      </h4>

      <p>
        The <code>index.html</code> file, found in the <code>public</code>{" "}
        folder, is like the grand entrance of your application.{" "}
        {`It's the first
        thing the browser sees and sets the stage for React to work its magic.
        Here's what it usually looks like:`}
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          {`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  <title>React App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>
`}
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with the <code>{`id="root"`}</code> is like
        a special marker that tells React,{" "}
        {` "Hey, this is where you should inject
        your JSX content and make it shine!"`}
      </p>

      <h4>
        Selecting the Target Element: <code>document.getElementById()</code>
      </h4>

      <p>
        The <code>document.getElementById()</code> method is like a spotlight
        that finds an HTML element by its ID. In our rendering code, we use it
        to locate the <code>root</code> element in the <code>index.html</code>{" "}
        file. This element is the designated spot where our JSX content will be
        displayed. By passing <code>{`'root'`}</code> to{" "}
        <code>document.getElementById()</code>,{" "}
        {`we're saying, "React, please
        render our JSX content right here!"`}
      </p>

      <p>
        Remember to make sure your project is all set up with the right
        dependencies and configurations before you hit the {` "go" `} button.
        This includes having the <code>react</code> and <code>react-dom</code>{" "}
        packages installed and the correct HTML entry point (
        <code>index.html</code>) in the <code>public</code> folder.
      </p>
      <div className="button-container">
        <button onClick={() => (window.location.href = "/JSXAttributes")}>
          back
        </button>
        <button onClick={() => (window.location.href = "/funcComp")}>
          Next
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
