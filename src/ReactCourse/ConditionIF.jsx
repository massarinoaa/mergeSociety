      <h2>React Conditional Rendering: Dynamic and Adaptive UIs</h2>
      <p>
        React's conditional rendering allows you to create dynamic and adaptive
        user interfaces. It enables you to display different components or
        content based on certain conditions, making your applications more
        flexible and responsive. Let's explore the world of conditional
        rendering and learn how to efficiently render components conditionally
        in your React applications.
      </p>

      <h3>Understanding Conditional Rendering</h3>
      <p>
        Conditional rendering in React refers to the practice of rendering
        different components or content based on certain conditions. It allows
        your application to adapt to different scenarios and display the
        appropriate UI elements. With conditional rendering, you can create
        dynamic and interactive user interfaces that respond to changes in your
        application.
      </p>

      <h4>What is Conditional Rendering?</h4>
      <p>
        Conditional rendering is a technique used to render different UI
        elements based on specific conditions. These conditions can be the value
        of a variable, the result of a function, or the state of your
        application. By using conditional rendering, you can make your
        application more dynamic and responsive to changes in data or user
        interactions.
      </p>

      <h4>Why Use Conditional Rendering?</h4>
      <p>Conditional rendering offers several benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Dynamic UIs:</strong> Conditional rendering allows you to
          create dynamic user interfaces that adapt to different conditions.
          This means that your UI can change based on the values of variables,
          user actions, or data received from an API.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Conditional rendering enables you
          to display different content or components based on factors such as
          screen size, user preferences, or data availability. This helps you
          build responsive and adaptive UIs that work well on different devices
          and screen sizes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Code Reusability:</strong> Conditional rendering promotes code
          reusability by allowing you to render the same component with
          different content based on certain conditions. For example, you can
          render a list of items with different styles or additional information
          based on user preferences.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps to Implement Conditional Rendering</h3>
      <p>Here are the steps to implement conditional rendering in React:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Define Conditions:</strong> Determine the conditions that will
          trigger different rendering outcomes. These conditions can be based on
          variables, functions, or application state.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use Conditional Operators:</strong> Utilize conditional
          operators like <code>if</code>, <code>else if</code>, and{" "}
          <code>else</code> to render different components or content based on
          the defined conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Render Conditionally:</strong> Use the defined conditions to
          render the appropriate components or content. You can conditionally
          render entire components, JSX elements, or specific parts of your UI.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
      <h4>1. Defining Conditions</h4>
      <p>Let's define some simple conditions for our example:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>{`
// App.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(false);

  // ...
}

export default App;
`}</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this code, we define a condition called <code>isDarkMode</code> using
        the <code>useState</code> hook. We'll use this condition to determine
        whether to render components in dark mode or light mode.
      </p>

      <h4>2. Using Conditional Operators</h4>
      <p>
        Now, let's use conditional operators to render components based on the
        defined condition:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>{`
// ...

return (
  <div>
    <h2>{isDarkMode ? "Dark Mode Dashboard" : "Light Mode Dashboard"}</h2>
    {/* Additional components for the respective mode */}
  </div>
);

// ...
`}</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this code, we use the ternary operator (
        <code>condition ? true : false</code>) to conditionally render different
        content. If the <code>isDarkMode</code> condition is true, we render the
        dark mode dashboard. Otherwise, we render the light mode dashboard.
      </p>

      <h4>3. Rendering Conditionally</h4>
      <p>
        Let's render components conditionally based on the defined condition:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>{`
// ...

return (
  <div>
    <h2>{isDarkMode ? "Dark Mode Dashboard" : "Light Mode Dashboard"}</h2>
    {/* Additional components for the respective mode */}
  </div>
);

// ...
`}</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this code, we use the <code>isDarkMode</code> condition with the
        ternary operator to render the appropriate dashboard.
      </p>

      <h3>Putting It All Together</h3>
      <p>Let's see the complete example:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>{`
// App.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{isDarkMode ? "Dark Mode Dashboard" : "Light Mode Dashboard"}</h2>
      {/* Additional components for the respective mode */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
`}</code>
      </pre>

      <h3>Explanation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Define Conditions:</strong> We define a condition called{" "}
          <code>isDarkMode</code> using the <code>useState</code> hook. This
          condition will determine whether to render components in dark mode or
          light mode.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use Conditional Operators:</strong> We use the ternary
          operator (<code>condition ? true : false</code>) to conditionally
          render different content based on the defined condition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Render Conditionally:</strong> We use the defined condition to
          render components conditionally. If the condition is true, we render
          components in dark mode. If the condition is false, we render
          components in light mode.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Note</h3>
      <p>
        Conditional rendering in React allows you to create flexible and
        responsive user interfaces. By rendering components or content based on
        certain conditions, you can make your application more dynamic and
        interactive. Remember to use conditional operators like <code>if</code>,{" "}
        <code>else if</code>, and <code>else</code> to efficiently render
        different UI elements based on specific conditions.
