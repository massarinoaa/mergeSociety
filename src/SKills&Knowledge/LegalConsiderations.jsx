      <h2>Copyright Laws: Understanding Your Rights</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Automatic Protection:</strong> In most countries, copyright
          protection is automatic as soon as your work is fixed in a tangible

          <strong>Exclusive Rights:</strong> Copyright owners have the exclusive
          right to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, and create

          <strong>Fair Use:</strong> Fair use allows limited use of copyrighted
          material for purposes like criticism, commentary, news reporting,
          teaching, and research. It balances the rights of copyright owners and
          users.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Copyright Infringement:</strong> Copyright infringement occurs

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Licensing: Granting Permission to Use Your Work</h2>
      <p>
        {`Licensing is a way to grant permission to others to use your

        that allows you to control how your work is used and generate revenue.
        Here's how licensing can benefit you:`}
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Generating Revenue:</strong> Licensing your work can provide a
          steady income stream as licensees pay for the right to use your
          intellectual property.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Retaining Ownership:</strong> Licensing allows you to retain
          ownership of your intellectual property while granting others the
          right to use it under specific terms and conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flexibility:</strong> Licensing agreements can be tailored to
          your specific needs, including the scope of rights granted,
          exclusivity, and territorial restrictions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protection:</strong> Licensing agreements can include
          provisions for confidentiality, warranties, and indemnification to
          protect both parties.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Types of Licenses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Exclusive License:</strong> Grants exclusive rights to the
          licensee, meaning no one else can use the intellectual property in the
          specified manner.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-Exclusive License:</strong> Allows the licensor to grant
