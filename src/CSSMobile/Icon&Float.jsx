      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Choose Icons Carefully:</strong> Select icons that align with
          your brand and convey the intended message effectively. Avoid using
          too many different icon styles or sizes, as consistency is key to a
          cohesive design.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ensure Accessibility:</strong> Icons should be accessible to
          all users, including those using assistive technologies. Provide
          appropriate alternative text (alt text) for icons to describe their
          purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use Icons Sparingly:</strong> Icons should complement your
          content, not overwhelm it. Use icons strategically and only where they
          add value to the user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Keep Icons Responsive:</strong> Ensure that icons scale and
          adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Test your icons on
          various devices to ensure they remain visible and functional.

      <h1>Introduction to Floats in CSS</h1>
      <p>
        In CSS, the float property is used to align elements horizontally within
        their container. {`It's`} a fundamental tool for creating layouts,
        especially when you want elements to wrap around each other or align
        side by side. Imagine a magazine layout where text flows around images —
        {`that's`} the essence of what float does!
      </p>
      <h3>Basic Syntax:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          {`
  .element {
    float: left | right | none | inherit;
  }
      `}
        </code>
      </pre>
      <ul>
        <li>left: The element floats to the left.</li>
        <li>right: The element floats to the right.</li>
        <li>none: The element does not float. This is the default value.</li>
        <li>
          inherit: The element inherits the float value from its parent element.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Example 1: Floating an Image</h3>
      <p>
        {`Let's`} say you have an image you want to float to the left of some
        text.
        {`Here's`} how you would do it:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          {`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Floating an Image</title>
    <style>
        .image {
            float: left;
            margin-right: 10px; /* Optional: Add some spacing between the image and text */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

<img src="example.jpg" alt="Example Image" class="image">
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed et ligula 
ac quam mollis congue. Vestibulum id quam in mi tincidunt elementum vel at nunc.
</p>

</body>
</html>
      `}
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this example, the float: left; property tells the image to float to
        the left of the text.
      </p>
      <h3> Example 2: Creating a Simple Layout</h3>
      <p>{`Let's`} say you want to create a basic two-column layout:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          {`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Simple Layout</title>
    <style>
        .column {
            float: left;
            width: 50%; /* Each column takes up half of the container's width */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="column">
    <h2>Column 1</h2>
    <p>This is the content of column 1.</p>
</div>

<div class="column">
    <h2>Column 2</h2>
    <p>This is the content of column 2.</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>
      `}
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Here, both .column elements are floated to the left, causing them to
        align side by side.
      </p>
      <p>
        The float property in CSS is a powerful tool for creating layouts and
        arranging elements horizontally. {`It's`} commonly used in combination
        with other CSS properties to achieve complex designs. Remember to use it
        wisely, as improper use can lead to unexpected layout issues. As you
        continue to practice and experiment, {`you'll`} become more comfortable
        with its nuances and possibilities!
      </p>
      <h2>The Clear Property</h2>
      <p>
        When {`you're`} floating elements, sometimes you need to ensure that an
        element {`doesn't`} float next to a floated element. This is where the
        clear property comes in handy.
      </p>
      <h2>Example: Clearing Floats</h2>
      <p>
        {`Let's`} say you have a container with two floated elements inside, and
        you want to insert a non-floated element below them. You would use the
        clear property to ensure it {`doesn't`} float alongside the other
        elements.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          {`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Clearing Floats</title>
    <style>
        .float-left {
            float: left;
            width: 50%; /* Each column takes up half of the container's width */
        }
        .clear {
            clear: both;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="float-left">
    <h2>Float Left</h2>
    <p>This is the content of the left floated element.</p>
</div>

<div class="float-left">
    <h2>Float Left</h2>
    <p>This is the content of the left floated element.</p>
</div>

<div class="clear">
    <h2>Clear</h2>
    <p>This is the non-floated element.</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>
      `}
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this example, the .clear class is applied to the element we want to
        ensure does not float next to the floated elements. This causes it to
        move below them, effectively clearing the floats.
