      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Picture this:{" "}
        {`It's April 1995, and Brendan Eich is on a mission. He's
        working at Netscape, one of the early browser companies, and he's given
        just 10 days to cook up a programming language that can work directly in
        a web browser. Why the rush? Because Netscape's in a browser battle with
        Microsoft, and they need to get their browser out there ASAP. So,
        Brendan pulls off a miracle and creates JavaScript (also known as JS).
        It's not perfect, but it's a start.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, JavaScript is an essential tool for web development, mobile app
        development, and server-side programming. Its versatility and widespread
        adoption make it a crucial skill for any aspiring developer.
      </p>
      <h3>History of JavaScript</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript quickly becomes a web superstar. {`It's`} the first language
        that browsers understand right out of the box. Together with HTML and
        CSS, it forms the backbone of the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the early days, JavaScript was used primarily for adding cool effects
        and making web pages interactive. However, with the release of jQuery
        and AJAX in 2005, {`JavaScript's`} popularity soared. These tools made
        it easy to do all sorts of fancy stuff on websites, like updating
        content without reloading the page.
      </p>
      <h3>Features of JavaScript</h3>
      <p>JavaScript is a programming language that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Is friendly:</strong> {`JavaScript's`} syntax is designed to
          be easy to read and write, making it a great language for beginners
          and experienced developers alike. Its built-in features, such as
          functions and objects, make it easy to write concise and efficient
          code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Plays well with others:</strong> JavaScript can be used with a
          variety of frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, and Vue.
          {`It's`} also commonly used with other languages, like HTML and CSS,
          to create dynamic web applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Is always ready to go:</strong> {`JavaScript's`} dynamic
          nature means that you can write code and see the results immediately,
          without needing to compile or build your project. This makes it ideal
          for rapid prototyping and development.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Is open-minded:</strong> In JavaScript, variables can be
          assigned different data types, such as numbers, strings, or objects.
          This flexibility makes it easy to write code {`that's`} adaptable to
          different situations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Is a bit laid-back:</strong>{" "}
          {`JavaScript's relaxed type system
          means that you don't need to declare variable types upfront.`}{" "}
          While this can lead to errors if not managed carefully, it also allows
          for more flexibility and creativity in your code.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>JavaScript Versions</h3>
      <p>
        The ECMAScript standardization process ensures that JavaScript remains a
        consistent and evolving language. {`Here's`} a brief overview of some of
        the most notable versions:
      </p>
      <table border="1" style={{ borderCollapse: "collapse", padding: "10px" }}>
        <tr>
          <th>Version</th>
          <th>Release Date</th>
          <th>Notable Features</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ES5</td>
          <td>2009</td>
          <td>Strict mode, JSON support</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ES6 (ES2015)</td>
          <td>2015</td>
          <td>Classes, promises, async/await</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ES7 (ES2016)</td>
          <td>2016</td>
          <td>Async/await, exponentiation operator</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>There are even more versions till date</p>
      <p>
        {`Don't worry too much about the details just yet. For now, just know that
        JavaScript is always evolving, and there's always something new to
        learn!`}

      <h1>JavaScript Basics: How to Insert and Run Your Code</h1>

      <p>
        {`
        Welcome to our JavaScript tutorial! In this comprehensive guide, we'll
        dive into how to insert JavaScript into HTML and execute it. Don't worry
        if you're new to coding—we'll walk you through everything step by step.`}
      </p>

      <h2>Inserting JavaScript into HTML</h2>

      <p>
        {`Let's`} start with the basics: adding JavaScript code to your HTML
        documents. There are a few ways to do this, each with its own
        advantages.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Inline Script Tags ({`<script>`} tag within HTML)</h3>
      <pre>
        {`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Inline Script Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <script>
    alert("This is an alert message from inline JavaScript!");
  </script>
</body>
</html>
      `}
      </pre>
      <p>
        The <code>{`<script>`}</code> tag is an HTML element used to insert
        JavaScript code directly into an HTML document. {`It's`} like adding
        instructions directly into the webpage itself. For example, you can use
        it to display alert messages, as shown above.
      </p>

      <h3>2. External Script Files ( {`<script src=".."> tag`})</h3>
      <pre>
        {`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>External Script Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <script src="myScript.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
      `}
      </pre>
      <p>
        Another method is to link an external JavaScript file using the{" "}
        <code>src</code> attribute of the <code>{`<script>`}</code> tag. This
        keeps your HTML clean and separates your JavaScript code into reusable
        files. For instance, you might have a file called{" "}
        <code>myScript.js</code> where you store your JavaScript functions.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Event Handlers ({`<button onclick="..">`})</h3>
      <pre>
        {`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Event Handler Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <button onclick="showAlert()">Click Me!</button>
  <script>
    function showAlert() {
      alert("Button clicked!");
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
      `}
      </pre>
      <p>
        Event handlers are a way to run JavaScript code in response to user
        actions, such as clicking a button. In the example above, when the
        button is clicked, the <code>showAlert</code> function is executed,
        displaying an alert message.
      </p>

      <p>
        Remember, if some of this code seems confusing right now,{" "}
        {`don't worry!
        We'll`}{" "}
        break down each part in more detail in future lessons. For now, focus on
        understanding the basics of how to insert and run JavaScript code in
        your web pages.
      </p>

      <h2>Displaying JavaScript Code Output</h2>

      <p>
        Now that {`we've inserted our JavaScript code, let's`} explore different
        ways to see its output and interact with it.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Using the Console</h3>

      <p>
        The console is a tool provided by web browsers that allows developers to
        see messages and errors generated by their JavaScript code. {`It's`}{" "}
        like a window into the behind-the-scenes workings of your code.
      </p>

      <pre>
        {`
// Print a message to the console
console.log('Hello, World!');
      `}
      </pre>

      <p>
        To open the console, you can usually right-click on your webpage and
        select{" "}
        {`"Inspect" or "Inspect Element" to open the developer tools. Then
        navigate to the "Console"`}{" "}
        tab. The <code>console.log()</code> method is commonly used to print
        messages to this console, allowing you to debug your code and see{" "}
        {`what's`} happening at different points.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Using Dialog Boxes</h3>

      <p>
        Dialog boxes are pop-up messages that can be displayed to the user by
        your JavaScript code. {`They're`} useful for providing information or
        prompting the user for input.
      </p>

      <pre>
        {`
// Alert dialog box
alert('This is an alert message.');

// Confirm dialog box
let result = confirm('Do you want to proceed?');
console.log('User choice:', result);

// Prompt dialog box
let name = prompt('Enter your name:');
console.log('Hello,'+ name + '!');
      `}
      </pre>

      <p>
        Alert boxes display a message to the user, confirm boxes ask for
        confirmation with {`"Ok" or "Cancel"`} buttons, and prompt boxes prompt
        the user for input. These can be useful for interacting with users in
        your web applications.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        Congratulations!{" "}
        {`You've learned how to insert JavaScript into HTML and
        run it, as well as different methods for displaying output. Now it's
        time to practice what you've`}{" "}
