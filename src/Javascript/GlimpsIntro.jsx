      <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to the fascinating world of JavaScript! JavaScript is a
        versatile and powerful programming language that serves as the backbone
        of modern web development. It is one of the core technologies of the
        World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. With JavaScript, developers can
        create dynamic, interactive, and immersive web experiences that
        captivate users.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript is often referred to as the "scripting language of the web"
        due to its ability to add functionality and behavior to web pages. It
        brings web pages to life, making them responsive and engaging. But
        JavaScript is more than just a scripting language; it is a full-fledged
        programming language with a rich set of features and capabilities.
      </p>

      <h2>History of JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich during his time at
        Netscape Communications Corporation. Initially developed in just 10 days
        under the name Mocha, it was later renamed to LiveScript and finally to
        JavaScript. The name "JavaScript" is a bit misleading, as the language
        has little to do with Java. It was chosen for marketing reasons, and the
        language quickly gained popularity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since its inception, JavaScript has evolved significantly. It has grown
        from a simple scripting language to a powerful, feature-rich programming
        language. The language continues to evolve, with regular updates and new
        features added to keep it modern and efficient. The latest version,
        ECMAScript 2022, introduces exciting new capabilities that further
        enhance the language's versatility.
      </p>

      <h2>How JavaScript Works</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript runs in the browser, allowing it to respond to user actions
        such as clicks, inputs, and other events. It can manipulate the Document
        Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure and content of a web
        page. By modifying the DOM, JavaScript can dynamically update and
        enhance web pages in real-time.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript can also be used on the server-side with Node.js, enabling
        developers to build scalable and efficient server-side applications.
        This versatility allows developers to use a single language for both
        front-end and back-end development, simplifying the development process.
      </p>

      <h2>JavaScript in Action</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine a user filling out a registration form on a website. With
        JavaScript, you can validate the user's input in real-time, ensuring
        that the entered data meets certain criteria before submission. This
        provides immediate feedback to the user and improves the overall user
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or consider a dynamic news website where new articles are loaded as the
        user scrolls down the page. JavaScript can fetch the additional content
        from the server and update the webpage without requiring a full page
        reload. This creates a seamless and responsive browsing experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Getting Started with JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        As you embark on your JavaScript journey, you'll start with the basics:
        variables, data types, operators, and control flow. You'll learn how to
        include JavaScript in your web pages and how to interact with HTML
        elements using the DOM. From there, you'll explore more advanced topics
        like functions, objects, arrays, and event handling.
      </p>

      <h2>The Future of JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript continues to evolve and adapt to meet the changing needs of
        web development. With each new version, the language becomes more
        powerful, efficient, and secure. The community plays a crucial role in
        driving the language forward, contributing to its growth and
        improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        As web technologies advance, JavaScript remains at the forefront,
        enabling developers to build cutting-edge web applications. Its
        versatility and widespread adoption ensure that it will remain a
        fundamental language for years to come.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript is an essential language for anyone aspiring to create
        modern, dynamic, and interactive websites. It empowers developers to
        build engaging user experiences, enhance web applications, and push the
        boundaries of what's possible on the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you continue your journey through this course, you'll unlock the
        secrets of JavaScript, gaining the skills and knowledge to create
        remarkable web applications that stand out. Happy coding!

      <h1>JavaScript Basics: How to Insert and Run Your Code</h1>

      <p>
        {`
        Welcome to our JavaScript tutorial! In this comprehensive guide, we'll
        dive into how to insert JavaScript into HTML and execute it. Don't worry
        if you're new to coding—we'll walk you through everything step by step.`}
      </p>

      <h2>Inserting JavaScript into HTML</h2>

      <p>
        {`Let's`} start with the basics: adding JavaScript code to your HTML
        documents. There are a few ways to do this, each with its own
        advantages.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Inline Script Tags ({`<script>`} tag within HTML)</h3>
      <pre>
        {`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Inline Script Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <script>
    alert("This is an alert message from inline JavaScript!");
  </script>
</body>
</html>
      `}
      </pre>
      <p>
        The <code>{`<script>`}</code> tag is an HTML element used to insert
        JavaScript code directly into an HTML document. {`It's`} like adding
        instructions directly into the webpage itself. For example, you can use
        it to display alert messages, as shown above.
      </p>

      <h3>2. External Script Files ( {`<script src=".."> tag`})</h3>
      <pre>
        {`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>External Script Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <script src="myScript.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
      `}
      </pre>
      <p>
        Another method is to link an external JavaScript file using the{" "}
        <code>src</code> attribute of the <code>{`<script>`}</code> tag. This
        keeps your HTML clean and separates your JavaScript code into reusable
        files. For instance, you might have a file called{" "}
        <code>myScript.js</code> where you store your JavaScript functions.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Event Handlers ({`<button onclick="..">`})</h3>
      <pre>
        {`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Event Handler Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <button onclick="showAlert()">Click Me!</button>
  <script>
    function showAlert() {
      alert("Button clicked!");
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
      `}
      </pre>
      <p>
        Event handlers are a way to run JavaScript code in response to user
        actions, such as clicking a button. In the example above, when the
        button is clicked, the <code>showAlert</code> function is executed,
        displaying an alert message.
      </p>

      <p>
        Remember, if some of this code seems confusing right now,{" "}
        {`don't worry!
        We'll`}{" "}
        break down each part in more detail in future lessons. For now, focus on
        understanding the basics of how to insert and run JavaScript code in
        your web pages.
      </p>

      <h2>Displaying JavaScript Code Output</h2>

      <p>
        Now that {`we've inserted our JavaScript code, let's`} explore different
        ways to see its output and interact with it.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Using the Console</h3>

      <p>
        The console is a tool provided by web browsers that allows developers to
        see messages and errors generated by their JavaScript code. {`It's`}{" "}
        like a window into the behind-the-scenes workings of your code.
      </p>

      <pre>
        {`
// Print a message to the console
console.log('Hello, World!');
      `}
      </pre>

      <p>
        To open the console, you can usually right-click on your webpage and
        select{" "}
        {`"Inspect" or "Inspect Element" to open the developer tools. Then
        navigate to the "Console"`}{" "}
        tab. The <code>console.log()</code> method is commonly used to print
        messages to this console, allowing you to debug your code and see{" "}
        {`what's`} happening at different points.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Using Dialog Boxes</h3>

      <p>
        Dialog boxes are pop-up messages that can be displayed to the user by
        your JavaScript code. {`They're`} useful for providing information or
        prompting the user for input.
      </p>

      <pre>
        {`
// Alert dialog box
alert('This is an alert message.');

// Confirm dialog box
let result = confirm('Do you want to proceed?');
console.log('User choice:', result);

// Prompt dialog box
let name = prompt('Enter your name:');
console.log('Hello,'+ name + '!');
      `}
      </pre>

      <p>
        Alert boxes display a message to the user, confirm boxes ask for
        confirmation with {`"Ok" or "Cancel"`} buttons, and prompt boxes prompt
        the user for input. These can be useful for interacting with users in
        your web applications.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        Congratulations!{" "}
        {`You've learned how to insert JavaScript into HTML and
        run it, as well as different methods for displaying output. Now it's
        time to practice what you've`}{" "}
